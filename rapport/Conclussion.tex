\section{Conclusion}

* Our language was a bit to simple to show really interesting things?
* compare our axioms to hard coded rules and why this approch is better/different.
* We have shown that in this model we can find optimisations that are not easy
to find otherwise (x + y == y + x) 
* We have a fast implementation, for languages that doesn't contain scope 
 + relationalalgebras
 + mathematical formulas (without forall/exists)
 + propositional logic

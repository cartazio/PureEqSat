\section{Conclusion}
In the result we have seen that this model of doing optimisations can find interesting
optimisations that are difficult to find using normal optimisations techniques\cite{santos}.
For example we showed that the following snippet would be optimised to true even
when we don't know what the values of either $x$ nor $y$ are.

\begin{verbatim}
x + y == y + x
\end{verbatim}

This is akin to a proof search, we find terms that are equal by applying axioms
and we get a proof\footnote{We can only call it a proof if the axioms really are 
consistent with our equivalence relation.} that $x + y \sim y + x$. This proof
is used by another proof that says that semantical equal terms will evaluate to 
True by the == operator in the language.

But since we havn't yet tackled the issue with scope since it contains complications
with variable-bindings that can flee from the scope. 

* Our language was a bit to simple to show really interesting things?
* compare our axioms to hard coded rules and why this approch is better/different.
* We have shown that in this model we can find optimisations that are not easy
to find otherwise (x + y == y + x) 
* We have a fast implementation, for languages that doesn't contain scope 
 + relationalalgebras
 + mathematical formulas (without forall/exists)
 + propositional logic

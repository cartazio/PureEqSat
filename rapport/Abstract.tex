This work has been done for the course Frontiers of Programming Languages during
the month of September in 2010. It presents a novel way of doing optimizations
in the style of equality saturation. This explores the space of equivalent terms
to find the best i.e. the optimized term. In difference to other approaches all
terms will be saved and can be used to find new equivalent terms.

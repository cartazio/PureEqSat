\section{Future work}
For future work we would like to be able to have a solution how we should handle
scope. This is something that would really make this technique more useful for
optimising real functional languges. Because other than scope it seems to be a 
really nice fit for functional languages that put alot of effort into having semantics
that makes it easier to do equality reasoning.

Another direction that would be interesting to investigate further has to do with
the cost function. Currently we have put requirements on the shape of the cost function
which made it simpler to compute the best representant. An extension could be that
when choosing a term from a class, that would be saved into a variable. So the next
time we need the element from that class we can use the same variable and they would
share the cost. This makes it difficult because non-local choices can affect how
the value of a term.

Yet further would be to optimise the pattern matcher, currently it goes through 
every term in then class and searches for a match. If we instead were able to 
record the new elements we could save work because we don't have to try to match
the same term as often. A solution here could be to register callbacks so when a
term of a certain shape is added to the class we can call the rule that matches with
the correct terms.

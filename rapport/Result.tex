\section{Result}
* cool examples:  x + y == y + x, show number of rules
* Some timing of examples.. <- what sort of time should we take?
-- we can't compare the results against the pre-optimized, we only have our cost function.
a sure, cost function result.
* Simple ordo ananlysis? for parts of algorithm.
* issues with scope? <-- resultat eller vart?
